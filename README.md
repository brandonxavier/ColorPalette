ColorPalette
============

Basic CSS Colors and Simple Demo

This is simply the standard 140 or so CSS colors preloaded into an object (colorPalette)
in order to conveniently use their names rather than hex values.  I don't recall
exactly which reference I pulled these from -- there's thousands of freely available
sources for the info.

 Also included is a simple little demo to aid in choosing color schemes.
